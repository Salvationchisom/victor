 <h1>Education in the Developing World</h1>

<p>
“The opportunity for every child to learn and to
 make the most of their
 talents is at the heart 
 of a fairer society. Yet in country after country it is wealth, not talent, that dictates a child’s educational destiny.… This reality is failing individual children, each of whom has a right to education. It is also failing society, as a generation of talented poor girls and boys cannot fulfil their promise and contribute fully to human progress. Brilliant doctors, teachers or entrepreneurs are instead herding goats or collecting water. Humanity faces unprecedented challenges. Yet instead of utilizing the talents of all of people, inequality means we are squandering this potential.”

Understanding the Numbers: Good News and Bad
More people in the world today are educated than ever before. In 1820 only 12% of the people in the world could read and write. Today the share is reversed: only 17% of the world’s population remains illiterate. Primary school enrollment is now almost universal in most countries, with as many girls enrolling as boys.

Nevertheless, these figures oversh
adow the impact of persistent inequity.</p> <p>Some 63 million children of primary school age were out of school in 2016 and progress on primary school enrollment remains flat. Most impacted are the world’s poorest countries, where the lack of basic education is a hard constraint on development. In Niger, for example, just 36.5% of 15- to 20-year-olds are literate.

Oxfam caught the world’s attention in 2014 with the astounding statistic that just 85 individuals had the same wealth as the 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world’s population. Three years later the number was down to 43, and in 2018 to just 26. In their annual report to the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos, Public Good or Private Wealth, Oxfam takes a strong, unequivocal position: this spiraling inequity must be checked, and the way to do it is for all governments to provide universal health care, education and social protection, free at the point of delivery, funded by fair taxation of rich individuals and corporations. Governments, says Oxfam, must “Stop supporting privatization of public services.”

“For some time, the view of institutions like the World Bank was that public services should be rationed and minimal, and that the private sector is often a better provider. It was argued that individuals should pay for their schools and hospitals, market mechanisms should be used to organize services, and that social protection should be very limited and targeted only at the very poorest people. While some of the rhetoric,
 programming and advice has changed, including notably from the IMF, change in practice has been slower. This trend is too often compounded by the influence of elites over politics and governments, skewing public spending in the wrong direction and ensuring that it benefits the already wealthy rather than those who need it most. It is time to focus on what works. To most effectively reduce the gap between rich and poor, public services need to be universal, free, public, accountable and to work for women…
